**Solution**: Use a different email or login with existing credentials

### Issue: "Validation failed"
**Solution**: Check that all required fields are provided with correct data types

### Issue: "Route not found"
**Solution**: Verify the endpoint URL is correct and the server is running

### Issue: "MongoDB connection error"
**Solution**: Ensure MongoDB is running on your system

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **Frontend Integration**: Update your React components to use these endpoints
2. **Error Handling**: Add proper error handling in frontend
3. **Loading States**: Show loading indicators during API calls
4. **Token Management**: Store JWT token securely (localStorage or httpOnly cookies)
5. **File Upload**: Implement image upload in report form
6. **Real-time Updates**: Consider adding WebSocket for live updates
